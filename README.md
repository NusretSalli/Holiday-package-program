## Summary

The repository is a fun little project that given a location will extract relevant data such as temperature, humidity, among other things from the Openweathermap API and use these information to create a package of items and gadgets you need to have with you during your stay in said location.

The code in this repository is written in Python 3.10

THe code is run in the terminal, but later down the road a fully fledged website will be constructed with the Flask framework and with a dedicated database.
